Markdown Syntax
========

## Text decorations

We're talking about **bolds**, *italics*, and ~strikethroughs~.

This is another way to make __bold__ and _italicised_ words.

Now I can combine **_bolds and italics together_**.

## Bullet points, numbered lists and checked lists

### Bullet points

This is how you make bullet point list:
* bullet point 1
* bullet point 2
* bullet point 3

### Numbered lists

Numbered list:
1. second item
1. First item
1. third item

### Checked lists

TODO's and done's:
- [ ] item one
- [ ] item two
- [x] item three

## Tables

Let's make a clean table with markdown:

| Name | Age | Department | Job |
|---|---|---|---|
|Riku|25|biochemistry|ARF|
|Ruth|34|biochemistry|ARF|
|Mik|old|biochemistry|stats guy|

--------

## Markdown paragraphs, texts, and quotes

So this sentence contains only a single whitespace in between the words.

But            this            sentence       contains a lot of           whitespaces in            between the words.


This is how you print quotes:

> "You're a wizard, Harry"


----------

## Links/hyperlinks

The syntax is relatively simple:

This is a link to [Google](https://www.google.com)

-------

## Codes and syntax highlighting

You can insert codes inline with a pair `backticks`.

**DON'T RUN THIS CODE:**

```bash
echo hello world
cd /
rm -rf *
```
